# CSS-Only Monument Valley 2 Doortem

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/gabriellewee/pen/PjwgMq](https://codepen.io/gabriellewee/pen/PjwgMq).

Edited: Added some hover animations on the eye and overall, and changed the name to Doortem!

Inspired by ustwo games' Monument Valley 2. So excited to play this second iteration! You can find the totem from the first game here (https://codepen.io/gabriellewee/pen/zNBMmW).
